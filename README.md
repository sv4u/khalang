*The DJ Khaled Lisp Language*

This is a Lisp like language which uses various phrases and works that are said by the immaculate DJ Khaled.

## Implementation Plan

* Step 1: Implement language in Python
* Step 2: Translate implementation to C
* Step 2.5: Learn how to write a language in SML or OCaml
* Step 3: Translate C implementation to SML/OCaml


### Step 1

Plan of attack:

* Write a simple REPL
* Write basic functions for normal Lisp
* Translate those basic functions to Khaled Script
* Add compiling options to REPL

### Step 2

I haven't gotten here yet.

### Step 2.5

I haven't gotten here yet.

### Step 3

I haven't gotten here yet.
