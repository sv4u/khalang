*The DJ Khaled Lisp Language*

This is a Lisp like language which uses various phrases and works that are said by the immaculate DJ Khaled.

## Implementation Plan

* [ ] Step 1: Implement language in Python
* [ ] Step 2: Translate implementation to C
* [ ] Step 2.5: Learn how to write a language in SML or OCaml
* [ ] Step 3: Translate C implementation to SML/OCaml


### Step 1

*This step is to help me develop the language to its fullest form*

* [x] Write a simple REPL
* [x] Write basic functions for normal Lisp
* [x] Translate those basic functions to Khaled Script
* [ ] Add compiling options to REPL

### Step 2

*This step is to help me make the language quick and more optimized*

I haven't gotten here yet.

### Step 2.5

*This step is to help me learn more about functional languages and how to implement other languages in them*

I haven't gotten here yet.

### Step 3

*This is the ultimate goal*

I haven't gotten here yet.
